## Overview
We believe in being transparent about how we collect and use data. This privacy policy explains what information we collect when you use our website, how we use it, and what choices you have.

**TLDR; The exception of signing up for the newsletter and our CDN for security, your experience with Unum Examen will always remain anonymous.**
