The Act of Contrition is a vital prayer during confession in Catholic spiritual life, expressing genuine sorrow for sins and a firm resolve to amend one's life. While many Catholics know the [traditional form](https://www.usccb.org/prayers/act-contrition) by heart, both the Vatican and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) have approved several valid variations, including those found in the official Rite of Penance. This guide presents approved traditional and alternative Acts of Contrition, including psalm-based options, to enrich your experience of the sacrament.

## The most recommended act of contrition prayers
Many who grew up in the church tend to know a variation of one of these two prayers. The first is a traditional prayer:

> O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, 
and I detest all my sins because of thy just punishments, 
but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, 
who art all good and deserving of all my love. 
I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace to sin no more and to avoid the near occasion of sin. 
Amen.

The second prayer is from the Rite of Penance:

> My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.  
In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,  
I have sinned against you whom I should love above all things.  
I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance,  
to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.  
Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.  
In his name, my God, have mercy.
Amen.

## The most simple act of contrition prayer
A staple in the prayer life of the Eastern church, the Jesus prayer may also be used as an act of contrition:

>Lord Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.

## Acts of contrition prayers based on scripture
There are many potential verses from scripture that may suffice for an act of contriton. A few common valid options are come from the Psalms and the parable of the prodigal son in the Gospel of Luke:

> Be mindful of your compassion, O Lord, and of your merciful love, for they have been from of old. Remember not the sins of my youth, or my transgressions; according to your mercy remember me, for your goodness' sake, O Lord! (Psalm 25:6-7  RSV)

> Lord God, in your goodness have mercy on me: do not look on my sins, but take away all my guilt. Create in me a clean heart and renew within me an upright spirit. ([Adapted from Psalm 51](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/prayers/act-of-contrition.html))

> Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you' I am no longer worthy to be called your son (Luke 15:18 RSV)

While these generally are allowed, they're less common and the confessor may have a preference to one of the more traditional options for a particular confession due to it's comprehensiveness. As such, it may be recommended to still know one of the traditional options if you plan on using one of these.

## What matters most about your act of contrition
Whether you choose the traditional Act of Contrition or one of its approved alternatives, what matters most is the sincerity of your contrition and commitment to conversion. These prayers serve as trusted guides for expressing genuine sorrow and opening our hearts to God's boundless mercy in the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
